    <div style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #333; padding-top: 1rem;">
    <p>It all started in October 2011 ‚Äî ah yes, the year when <em>"Call Me Maybe"</em> was on repeat and I was just a guy trying to land a job near Mandaue. I didn‚Äôt notice her right away, but according to her, she already had her eyes on me ‚Äî apparently impressed by my long sleeves, my cheerful smile, and my mysterious charm (or maybe it was just my shampoo).</p>

    <p>Fast forward to Day 1 on the job: that's when <strong>I</strong> finally noticed <strong>her</strong>. She was the only girl who caught my eye ‚Äî like, literally, my neck did a full turn. I was curious, but didn‚Äôt think much of it. I mean, I wasn‚Äôt planning to fall in love. But fate, as always, had other plans.</p>

    <p>She kept glancing at me, or so I assumed ‚Äî maybe it was the curl in my lashes or my bold, bushy eyebrows that made her heart skip a beat. Whatever it was, I wasn‚Äôt complaining.</p>


    <p>Eventually, we got closer. I found out she was genuinely kind, always laughing, and had the kind of personality that grows on you like your favorite sitcom. She was quiet at first ‚Äî classic mysterious vibes ‚Äî but once she warmed up, she couldn‚Äôt stop talking and laughing. And her eyes? Big, round, and beautiful ‚Äî I was smitten.</p>

    <p>We were inseparable. During breaks, I‚Äôd pack food so we could eat together and share bites like we were already in our own little rom-com montage. At some point, I asked myself: ‚ÄúShould I go for it? Should I tell her how I feel?‚Äù I was scared, sure ‚Äî but I took the leap.</p>

    <p>For our first official date, we went to McDonald‚Äôs (because nothing says romance like fries and sundae). Now here‚Äôs where things get interesting: I hid a ring inside the sundae. With every spoonful she took, I panicked a little ‚Äî <em>‚ÄúDear Lord, please don‚Äôt let her swallow the ring!‚Äù</em> Thankfully, she found it <strong>before</strong> the ring made it to her digestive tract. I asked her to be my girlfriend ‚Äî and she said <strong>YES</strong>. Cue internal fireworks and a victory dance.</p>
 <p>To show her how special she was, I started bringing her a single stem of rose to work. Nothing fancy ‚Äî just a simple gesture that spoke volumes. I guess that really deepened her love for me. Of course, there were moments she got mad (because she‚Äôs the <em>"maldita"</em>). But over time, I realized it was just her way of asking for more attention. And that made me understand her more and taught me patience. Our love grew stronger every day we were together ‚Äî thorns and all.</p>
    <p>Years passed. We faced ups and downs like any couple, but we held on ‚Äî with love, trust, and late-night chicken nuggets.</p>

    <p>Then came Rosabelle ‚Äî our sweet, sassy little star who gave our lives even more purpose and joy. With her, everything felt right. That‚Äôs when I knew: it was time to make things official. With love in our hearts (and probably a Happy Meal nearby), I asked her to marry me.</p>

      <p>...and here we are, building our own happily ever after ‚Äî one laugh, one sundae, and one moment at a time.</p>
